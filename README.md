# Attrition-Rate-calculation-using-SAS

Objective:
To predict the attrition rate of a company based on the available employee data. Here we have fields like Age, Department, Environment Satisfaction, Distance from Home, Education, Education field, Hourly Rate, Job Level, Job Involvement, Job Satisfaction, Total Working Years, Years with Current Manager which have the scope to better predict the attrition rate in a company.
The Target field we choose for the project is Attrition.

Description:
We would like to predict the attrition rate using Classification method. We have done a testing of the data set using the Decision tree and have observed the below results. While testing, the fields have been selected automatically. However, in the final project we would select the fields manually and find out the attrition rate. We assume we have enough fields to find the attrition rate.

The Attrition rate we found using the dataset containing 1471 records is as follows:
‘No’ Attrition -1233 – 83.8%
‘Yes’ Attrition- 237– 16.1%
